# FrostyTracking - Streamlit-Powered Audit Analytics in Snowflake
FrostyTracking is a Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS) dashboard, fairly easy to surf and it provides 3 default sections:Â 
- Login Tracking
- Query Tracking
- DDL Tracking

The interesting aspect of this project is how to have dynamic filtering and parametrised queries getting inputs from the sidebar fields configuration area. It's possible to parametrize queries on:
- timeframe of the analysis
- definition of the top "n" results to extract
- possibility to filter out some users from the analysis.

### Streamlit in Snowflake Deployment
1) Download "frostytracking_sis.py" and "logo.png" from the GitHub repository.
2) Create a new Streamlit app on your Snowflake account
3) Paste the code into your new app.
4) Upload the "logo.png" in the Streamlit application stage.

NOTE: FrostyTracking is not intended to be a ready-to-use artifact but it merely provides a foundation on available features in Snowflake & Streamlit.
